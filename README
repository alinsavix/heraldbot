A simple bot to watch M.C.A. Hogarth's patreon community wall and echo
postings there onto her discord channel, since there's no other way to
get automatic notifications for them.

Kinda crappy code by a kinda crappy wuff, but it works, more or less.

Add the bot to your server by filling in the right spot on this URL and
clicking it (and authorizing):

    https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=0x00004C40

And run via something like:

    heraldbot --token 'discord_bot_token_here' --channel-listen jaguarholt:general --channel-announce jaguarholt:general --admin alinsa#9054 --admin mcahogarth#8422 --database /home/heraldbot/heraldbot.db
